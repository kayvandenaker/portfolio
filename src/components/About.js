          <h3>About</h3>
          {/* My name is Kay van den Aker (he/him). I am an interaction designer and creative technologist from the Netherlands. I am fascinated by the relationship between people and the ever smarter getting world and how design allows us to shape this alliance.
          <br/><br/>
          I combine technical problem solving and creative thinking to design innovative concepts and immersive prototypes. My approach is hands-on and explorative while focused on the users‚Äô and societal needs. */}
          My name is Kay van den Aker (he/him), I'm a design and tech enthousiast who likes to expore everything in between those. My approach is very hands-on and experience prototyping focused; showing is explaining, seeing is believing.
          <br/><br/>
          Besides design, I love to travel, do sports in/on/around water or anything with a board; surf, dive, skateboard, swim, snowboard or sail. You know, life is about living üèÑ
